# Protobuf Protoc Exe

This Python package is a wrapper for [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)'s `protoc` compiler.

Use this package to install a specific version of `protoc` in your project.

This repository does not contain any binaries on itself!
Instead, the binaries are downloaded from the official protobuf Github upon installation,  you don't have to trust this package much.
